                  I am more than confident to tell you that the best, most
                  effective and finest weapon an academic organization can ever
                  have is “knowledge” and it is a common quote in ICT field that
                  “knowledge is power”. The School of ICT works on the sole
                  objective of acquiring and propagating as much knowledge as
                  possible to the students.

                The field of Computer Science and Engineering has been pushing
                the envelope of almost all other disciplines, which use
                computing as a fundamental means of inquiry and tool for
                discovery. Computer Science and Engineering offers exciting,
                intellectually challenging, and rapidly growing career
                opportunities. It is the heart of where the action is: whether
                this means artificial intelligence applications, intelligent
                game playing, mobile applications, smart robots, cloud
                computing, data security, big data analytics, cyber security,
                and social networks. Teaching-Learning process is given at most
                priority in pursuit of improving the quality of technical
                education. Innovative teaching aids and methodologies are used
                by the department towards this goal. The efficacy of the
                Teaching-Learning process is reflected in the consistently
                excellent results being achieved every year. The department
                regularly organizes student development programme, short term
                training programme, conferences, seminars, webinars, workshops,
                expert lecturers, and expert lecture series for the students.
                Faculty development programs are organized for faculty to
                promote high standards in technical education. We, at the

                Electronics and Communication Engineering is one of the most
                fascinating fields for understanding and practicing. Even tiny
                pieces of device nugget possess incredible magic. A mobile phone
                takes the electromagnetic signal from the air, converts,
                compress and processes this information further and shove it
                again in the air. Jillions of these data in a very short span of
                time received these messages and sent reliably to the different
                corner of the globe. Everybody in the universe is connected
                wirelessly through just one identity number. The students of the
                department are nurtured in such a way they can be well
                recruitable in repute companies or become researchers after
                completion of their degree from the department. Further, I am
                confident that this bunch of professional talents, who are going
                to complete our studies from the department, will be of great
                value and a big asset to any organization they join.

                I warmly welcome you to the Department of Electronics and
                Communication Engineering, Gautam Buddha University. Over all
                these years, we have made progress in imparting technical
                education to our students and bring them at par with the
                ever-expanding horizons of Electronics and Communication
                Engineering and its application areas. At the under graduate
                level, we offer four-year B.Tech. Programme, and four-year
                B.Tech. (Engineering Design) Programme. At post graduate level,
                we offer three areas of specialization for two-year M.Tech.
                Programmes: (i) Wireless Communication and Networks, (ii) VLSI
                Design (iii) Railway Signalling Telecommunication and RAMS. We
                also offer Ph.D. Programmes for full time and working
                professional mode in all areas where research is being currently

            The students of Gautam Buddha University have been recruited in
            several National and International organisations and have proved to
            be a great asset to the organizations they joined. Our present
            graduates and post graduate would assuredly maintain the same level
            of performance and take their recruiting organizations to new
            heights in their respective fields. We highly value our partnership
            with alumni of Gautam Buddha University and remain committed to
            provide a productive and positive experience. We heartily invite the
            alumni organizations and graduating students to find the best match
            between their needs and capabilities. We are available for any
            requisite assistance & would ensure a positive & productive
            experience. Feedback & queries would be welcome and thoroughly
            entertained and suggestions would be appreciated.

          members of the university are prepared to take an extra step that
          separates excellence from merely adequate. As this is a residential

            Information and Communication Technology is one of the most
            fascinating fields for understanding and practicing. Even a tiny

            electromagnetic signal from the air, convert, compress and process
            this information and shove it again to air. Jillions of these data
            in a very short span of time received these message, and sent
            reliably to different corner of the globe. Everybody throught the
            universe is just connected wirelessly through just one number
            identity.

            that both, the students as well as the associated companies, get to
            meet their requirements with ease.

              <b>Research Project Description</b>: With the availability of
              meganuclease (ZFN, TALEN & CRISPR), tailored changes can be
              introduced into a eukaryotic genome at any desired gene. However,
              IPRs held by foreign organizations, high cost of synthesis and off
              target activity remain major constraints in adoption of this
              technology for commercial purpose. The proposed research project
              aims to develop material (synthetic gene sequences) and methods
              for robust high throughput custom designed TALEN synthesis.
              Further, methods will be developed for analysis of genome wide
              activity and specificity of newly developed TALENs, using next
              generation sequencing.
